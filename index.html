											<h3 class="major">SOLAR ECG WITH CLOUD STORAGE</h3>
											<p>The cardiovascular (CV) crisis is glaringly evident in developed as well as in developing countries.
												An Electrocardiograph (ECG) is a device that diagnose and detects heart abnormalities, which measures
												 electrical potentials on the surface of the body and creates a record (electrocardiogram) of the 
												 electrical currents associated with heart muscle activity. To reduce dependence on electricity, solar powered 
                                                ECG machines are introduced which has microchip that records patients details in it. Cloud Storage 
												is used to Store the data obtained from the microchip through Internet so that doctors from distant 
												places can access the stored instantly and express their opinion

											<h3 class="major">AC MOTOR FAULT ANALYSER BY CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS</h3>
											<p>A big challenge faced by major industries now a day is motor testing. At present motors are tested only 
												after they are assembled with other circuit components. The major drawback is that, if any fault is detected 
												in the motor after the assembly stage, the whole system has to be dismantled. In order to overcome the difficulty,
												we have come up with this new system with which the motor can be tested at its place which in turn gives a detailed 
												analysis of the type of the fault using Variable frequency drive for Induction motor and Servo drives for servo motors. 
												In this system , recoverable faults are analyzed using the characteristic waveforms of the motor, which is an easy 
												method compared to other methods of fault analysis .The Waveform is Displayed in HMI.</p>

											<h3 class="major">BRAIN CONTROLLED CAR FOR DISABLED USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
											<p>The scope of Artificial Intelligence is steadily increasing in the field of automobile and navigation. The artificial intelligence 
												has grown immensely, such that it can sense human brain activity. Artificial Intelligence has being greatly 
												helping the physically challenged people in the recent times. Using this scope of Artificial Intelligence, our 
												project is based on helping the disabled people to drive cars by continuously tracking their mental thinking. Since 
												these cars will rely only on what the individual is thinking they will hence not require any physical movement on the 
												part of the individual. The car is equipped with a lot of sensors like video, weather monitor, anti-collision etc. 
												The car is also equipped with automatic navigation in case of emergency. This technology will make the disabled, abled. 
												In the 40s and 50s, several researchers explored the connection between neurology, information theory, and cybernetics.
												 W. Grey Walter's turtles and Johns Hopkins Beast built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary 
												 intelligence. Several such researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton and the 
												 Ratio Club in England. Many such researchers want their work to be turned into a machine with general intelligence, 
												 called as strong AI, Consisting all the skills above and exceeding human abilities. A few researches believe that 
												 anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain will be required for such a project.</p>

											<h3 class="major">THERMOELECTRICITY GENERATOR</h3>
											<p>This Thermoelectricity Generator deals with production of Electricity using difference of Temperature. The Production of 
												Electricity by difference in Temperature is Known as SEEBECK EFFECT. Here we use Peltier Module which are Found in car electric 
												coolers as the Main component. Here The Peltier Module is heated up one side and then by using a CPU fan the other side of the Peltier
												 Module is cooled.So that by Seebeck Effect the electricity is Produced in the junction which can be checked using a Multimeter . 
												 Here we use a Radiator above which the Peltier module is placed for equal spreading of heat so that the efficiency gets Higher. 
												 By using this method we can charge up Mobile phone ,Laptops etc.</p>
